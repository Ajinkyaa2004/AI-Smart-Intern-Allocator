# 📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

The **Smart Internship Allocation System** addresses critical challenges faced by large-scale government internship programs such as the **PM Internship Scheme**.

With thousands of applicants and limited internship capacities across regions and sectors, traditional allocation systems struggle with:

❌ Skill mismatches  
❌ Preference conflicts  
❌ Delays and dropouts  
❌ Lack of transparency  

This project introduces an **AI-driven, explainable, and scalable allocation platform** built using the **MERN stack** to solve these issues.
